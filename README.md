server-status-perl
==================

Perl-based server status page. It is based on <<??>>.

This script is as easy as it gets. Just place a plain http://<whatevz>/ in a file named "domain.list". This file will the be loaded to memory. 
The script will then try to load all the statuses etc. for the required domain and write a little nice page on how stuff went.

We use this to just simply view what services is up at what point, simple as that. There is A LOT of improvements to be done, however that was not the 
main goal of this simple script. This simple script were designed to be .. simple :-).

Usage in apache-config:

Usage in ngix-config:
